Brynjolf Soundboard



Hi,I just wanted to make my own soundboard for a character from Skyrim whose name is Brynjolf. I just started coding on github, 
and am a rookie coder in general. I'm seeking help from anyone who can help me out. I have the first sound I wanted to put in as an mp3 file on my computer. It is called daft on my desktop, but I'm still having some problems with my code. Any help is welcomed, and thank you if you're reading this!
